ARMAGEDDON BROTHERHOOD OF STEEL

Gentlemen!

For Lab 1B it is all about testing!!!. Trying to figure out what is broken, why and how!!!  As you can see i have updated the repo and included some files and folder that you do not have. Before you download them, first go to Theos repo, under lab 1b and read the 1b_explanation. After reading, spin up your current enviroment and start trying to test with what you currently have. You will see that it is not working but the question is why? Try at first to figure out why? What is needed? Then look at the new files i have added. Add them and start testing again.
